# Origin

The **Alis** project originated from the Bachelor’s Degree Final Project (TFG) of **Pablo Perdomo Falcón**, presented as part of his studies at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC).

## First Version

The first version of Alis was developed as part of this TFG and consisted of a complete framework for game development on **Windows** and **macOS**. In addition to the framework itself, the project included an application designed to facilitate game creation, acting as an intuitive and accessible graphics engine. This tool allowed developers to design, build, and test their games within an integrated environment, simplifying the development process.

## Academic Recognition

Pablo Perdomo Falcón’s TFG was awarded **Honors**, the highest academic recognition given by the university. This achievement not only reflected the quality and potential of the project but also underscored the importance of continuing to develop and expand Alis as a reference tool in the field of game development.
