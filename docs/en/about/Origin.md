# Origin

The **Alis** project originated from the Bachelor’s Degree Final Project (TFG) of **Pablo Perdomo Falcón**, presented as part of his studies at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC).

## Context

The video game industry is one of the most significant sectors in entertainment. This means that more companies and independent developers are choosing to get involved in this field. Creating a video game is a complex task, involving the development of various aspects (updates, resource management, data persistence, etc.) that require significant effort yet add little value, as consumers expect these features to be present.

This project aims to enhance developer productivity by minimizing production costs. Consequently, **Alis** has been developed—a cross-platform framework that includes an intuitive API and up-to-date documentation. Additionally, as an open-source project, it fosters the creation of a collaborative community that can contribute to its development.


## First Version

The first version of Alis was developed as part of this TFG and consisted of a complete framework for game development on **Windows** and **macOS**. In addition to the framework itself, the project included an application designed to facilitate game creation, acting as an intuitive and accessible graphics engine. This tool allowed developers to design, build, and test their games within an integrated environment, simplifying the development process.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to dedicate this work to my family and sincerely thank my parents and sister for their unconditional support.

I also want to thank those GitHub users who, without any ulterior motives or self-interest, have offered their support during the testing phase and after the project's release, actively participating in various tasks and fostering the creation of a small collaborative community: **SPEEDCROW98, Chgv99, suarez0965, GabrielRT01, RaulLozanoPonce, Claudia2000pf**.

Lastly, I thank my tutors for the help they provided, making it easier for me to complete this final degree project.


## Academic Recognition

Pablo Perdomo Falcón’s TFG was awarded **Honors**, the highest academic recognition given by the university. This achievement not only reflected the quality and potential of the project but also underscored the importance of continuing to develop and expand Alis as a reference tool in the field of game development.
