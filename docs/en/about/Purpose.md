# Purpose of the Alis Project

**Alis** is an open-source game development framework designed to facilitate the creation of cross-platform games. Our goal is to provide developers of all levels with a powerful and accessible tool that allows them to build high-quality gaming experiences without having to worry about the complexities of adapting to different operating systems.

## Main Objectives

- **Accessibility**: Alis is designed to be user-friendly, even for those with limited experience in game development, offering an approachable learning curve without sacrificing functionality or flexibility.

- **Cross-Platform**: Alis supports multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. Support for Android and iOS will be added soon, allowing developers to bring their games to mobile devices without having to rewrite their codebase.

- **Flexibility and Power**: While Alis is accessible, it does not skimp on advanced features. The framework is robust enough to handle both simple and complex games, providing a wide range of tools and libraries that enable developers to customize their projects to meet specific needs.

- **Community and Collaboration**: As an open-source project, Alis greatly benefits from community collaboration. We encourage active participation in the development of the framework, whether through code contributions, bug reports, or creating documentation and tutorials to assist other developers.

## Future Vision

Alis is not just a framework; it is a growing community committed to innovation in game development. Our long-term goal is to make Alis one of the preferred choices for game developers worldwide, regardless of their experience level or the platforms they wish to target.

Join us on this exciting journey and contribute to the evolution of game development with Alis!
