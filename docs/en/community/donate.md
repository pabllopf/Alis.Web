# Support

**Alis** is an open-source game development framework created to offer a powerful and accessible tool to the developer community. Our goal is to continue providing this tool completely free of charge, with no plans to make it a paid product at any time. However, to maintain the project and ensure its ongoing improvement and sustainability, we need your support.

## Why Donate?

Although Alis is an open-source and free project, maintaining and developing a project of this scale requires time, effort, and resources. Donations allow us to:

- **Cover Infrastructure Costs**: Expenses related to servers, storage, and development tools.
- **Fund Development**: Support developers and contribute to the ongoing improvement of the framework.
- **Provide Support and Resources**: Offer technical support and update documentation to ensure that all users have an optimal experience.

Your support, whether large or small, is valuable to us. Hereâ€™s how you can make a donation:

1. **Online Donations**: Make a donation through our [secure donation platform](link-to-donation-platform). We accept various payment methods for your convenience.

## Commitment to Gratitude

We want to assure our community that **Alis** will always be 100% free. We have no intentions of turning it into a paid product. Your donation simply helps cover the necessary costs to maintain and improve the project, ensuring that we can continue providing a high-quality, accessible framework for everyone.
