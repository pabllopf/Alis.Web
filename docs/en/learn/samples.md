# ðŸŽ® Examples

To help you better understand how to use **Alis** in real-world projects, weâ€™ve prepared some examples that show the framework in action. These examples include fully functional code that you can study, modify, and run to accelerate your learning process.

## FlappyBird

One of the most popular examples is the **FlappyBird** project, a simple yet fun game that will show you how to create a complete game using **Alis**'s basic features.

### Game Description

In **FlappyBird**, you control a bird that must fly while avoiding obstacles in the form of pipes. The goal is to navigate between the pipes and score as many points as possible without colliding with them. The player controls the bird with a single button that allows the bird to "jump" or gain altitude, while gravity pushes it toward the ground.

The game has a simple cycle of start, play, game over, and the ability to restart after each session.

### Key Features

- **Simple Physics**: The flight behavior is determined by a basic gravity and impulse control system.
- **Collision System**: Accurate collision detection between the bird and the pipes.
- **Minimalist UI**: Simple and clear menus with an on-screen display of the current score.
- **Development Mode**: Ability to activate development mode to debug collisions and game behavior in real-time.
- **Multiplatform Optimization**: The game can run on different operating systems thanks to **Alis**.

### Game Screenshots

Here are some images showing the game in action:

### How to Access the Example

The source code for the **FlappyBird** example is available in the following GitHub repository:

[Alis.Sample.Flappy.Bird](https://github.com/pabllopf/Alis.Sample.Flappy.Bird)

This repository contains the entire project structure and resources needed for you to download and run the game in your local environment.

### Example Features

The **FlappyBird** example includes:

- **Sprite Handling**: Learn how to load and display images efficiently on the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Implementation of collisions between the character (bird) and obstacles (pipes).
- **Input Control**: Managing player input through keyboard or controller.
- **Basic Game Cycle**: Handling the logic for game start, end, and restart with well-defined states.
- **Optimization and Scalability**: Best practices to ensure the game runs smoothly even on devices with limited hardware.
