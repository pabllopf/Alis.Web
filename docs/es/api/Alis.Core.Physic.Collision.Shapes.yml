    description: >-
      A chain shape is a free form sequence of line segments.

      The chain has two-sided collision, so you can use inside and outside collision.

      Therefore, you may use any winding order.

      Connectivity information is used to create smooth collisions.

      WARNING: The chain will not collide properly if there are self-intersections.

    description: >-
      A line segment (edge) shape. These can be connected in chains or loops

      to other edge shapes.

      The connectivity information is used to ensure correct contact normals.

      A shape is used for collision detection. You can create a shape however you like.

      Shapes used for simulation in World are created automatically when a Fixture

      is created. Shapes may encapsulate a one or more child shapes.
