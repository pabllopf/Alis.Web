However, there are several common traits that characterize these types of games:</p>\n<h2 id=\"characteristics-of-indie-games\" sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\">Characteristics of Indie Games</h2>\n<ol sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\">Independent Development</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"8\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"8\">Indie games are often developed by a single person, small teams, or companies that are not classified as triple-A. The term &quot;triple-A&quot; emerged in the latter half of the 1990s as a marketing label used by major developers like Electronic Arts or Sony to refer to games involving significant investments in development and marketing, with high expectations for returns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"10\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"10\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"10\">Duration and Content</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\">Generally, indie games have less duration or content compared to games developed by large publishing companies. This is due to the time and resource constraints faced by independent developers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\">Funding</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"14\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"14\">Independent developers do not have the same financial backing as those working for large companies in the industry. In many cases, they do not receive external financial support and must cover their own costs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"16\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"16\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"16\">Budget and Tools</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\">Indie games often have reduced or zero budgets. To overcome these limitations, developers typically use open-source creation tools and distribute their products through digital distribution platforms on the internet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\">Creativity and Freedom</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"20\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"20\">Without being bound by commercial agreements, corporate guidelines, or player expectations, indie developers enjoy greater creative freedom. This allows them to create products that reflect their personalities and, in some cases, have been regarded as true works of art by experts in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"22\"><p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"22\"><strong sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"22\">Artistic Design and Innovation</strong></p>\n<ul sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">\n<li sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"23\">Indie games often stand out from conventional games due to the special attention given to artistic design or the development of new features in the user experience. This innovation and creativity frequently result in unique and memorable experiences for players.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p sourcefile=\"about/game_indies.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"25\">Indie games represent a vibrant and creative facet of the video game industry, offering unique and personalized experiences that stand out for their originality and the passion of their creators.</p>\n",
